TODO-

- [x] Implement Pagination for Card Database Page
- [x] Add Rest of Cards to Database
- [x] Move Basic Filtering to the Backend
- [x] Fix seeding of DB so cards match release sets( ordering issue)
- [ ] Fix duplicate rendering due to duplite keys on react 
- [] Create Advanced Filtering Backend
- [] Create Advanced Filtering UI 
- [] Do not allow duplicates of card ID in user inventory
- [] sessions for password hashing and authentification/authorization
- [] Currently Searching the database before adding a card to inventory needs to search all cards. If we instead have a table with all the release Sets, by id code ex: MRD,DUNE,DABL etc go to that table then see if it has a card code -0001, 0002 etc would be quicker. Instead of 37k rows instead it would be n card sets and m cards in the set.
